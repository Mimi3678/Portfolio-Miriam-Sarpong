            <h2><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> Project Scope</h2>
            <p>During my bachelor thesis, I had the opportunity to contribute to the further development of <strong>NORtritious</strong>, a nutrition calculator designed for the food cluster <strong>Fremtidsmat</strong>. This tool is aimed at supporting small and medium-sized food companies in their product development by ensuring their products meet the criteria for the Keyhole label and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) claims.</p>

            <p>In this project, I focused on enhancing the user interface and implementing nutrition claims, striving for a user-friendly and functional end product. Additionally, I took on the role of Scrum Leader, guiding our team to achieve our goals effectively. I also conducted user testing with some of Norway's biggest food producers, ensuring the tool meets industry needs and standards.</p>

            <p>This experience has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to apply and expand my skills in UI development, nutritional science, and project management.</p>
